> 🤖👨‍💻 - During the 1st information systems course, a group of 5 students was formed to develop a robot and put it to compete in FIAP's NEXT at the end of the 2nd semester. You can consult our project that was developed throughout the 1st year in this repertoire, both in the classroom and outside of it (shared repertoire).
